splitter
========

splitter is the code name for this simple program titled PDFSplit. PDFSplit is a very minimalistic GUI wrapper for pdftk. Currently it only cats sections and only allows a small bit of the pdftk grammar. This application is desined with one specific goal in mind; easily splitting large PDF combined reports.

Dependencies
============
* wxPython
* pdftk (currently must be in the same folder as splitter.py[1])


[1] PDFSplit is being designed to be self contained sitting somewhere on a Windows network.
